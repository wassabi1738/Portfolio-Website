Welcome to the code behind my vibrant, dark-themed portfolio an interactive playground of neon gradients, pill shaped navigation, and sleek, glass morphic cards. This single page site showcases my skills, projects, experience, and a mini in page blog, all tied together with smooth scrolling and subtle hover animations.
